Corben Baby Ace for X-Plane 11, by FTLX Designs

The Ace Baby Ace was the world's first aircraft to be marketed as a homebuilt aircraft when its plans were offered for sale in 1929. Plans are still available and Baby Aces are still being built today. Orland Corben designed a series of aircraft for the Ace Aircraft Manufacturing Company, the Baby Ace, Junior Ace, and Super Ace. Corben's name was associated with the aircraft, and it is commonly known as the Corben Baby Ace.

General characteristics:

Crew: one, pilot
Length: 17 ft 11 in (5.46 m)
Wingspan: 26 ft 6 in (8.08 m)
Height: 6 ft 7.75 in
Wing area: 112.3 ft² (10.43 m²)
Airfoil: Clark Y
Empty weight: 575 lb (261 kg)
Loaded weight: 950 lb (430 kg)
Powerplant: 1× Salmson, Szekely, Continental, or Anzani engine choices., 65-100 hp (50-75 kW)

Performance:
Maximum speed: 95 knots (110 mph, 176 km/h)
Service ceiling: 16,000 ft (4,900 m)
Rate of climb: 1,200 ft/min (370 m/min) 

Flying the Baby Ace:
To start the engine, click on the fuel cutoff lever, then turn on each of the magnetos.  Then, click the prop once (this turns on the battery, the original aircraft didn't have an electrical system) and then click/hold the prop to start the engine.  Rotation is usually around 40mph and you're usually off the ground before 60.  Approach is around 50-60 and touchdown is around 45-50 depending on weight. 

Please note that this aircraft was built using the Experimental Flight Model, so I make no guarantees how it will fly with that option turned off.

This aircraft has impressive STOL capability and usually requires less than 200 feet to complete the takeoff roll. It is a fantastic flier and is relativly easy to land despite being a taildragger. Watch your dive speed though, the modeled Continental A65 is only rated for 2300 RPM!  Enjoy flying this bird, it was a real pleasure bringing this to X-Plane.
